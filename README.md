## Background
  The GPStick is designed to use an [Arduino Uno Rev3](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-uno-rev3) to take input from the [Adafruit Ultimate GPS Breakout](https://www.adafruit.com/product/746) and output GPS directions with a [DFPlayer Mini](https://wiki.dfrobot.com/DFPlayer_Mini_SKU_DFR0299) connected to a 3W 8Ohm speaker. It is all encapsulated into a custom-made laser-cut wooden box to be attached to a walking stick.
  ```C
Serial.println("ayyy");
```
