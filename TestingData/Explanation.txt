This folder contains the raw data acquired from testing the capabilities of the GPS device.

NMEA_DATA contains all NMEA sentences from a jaunt on the road. 
We calculated and interpreted the data accordingly to conclude that the data was accurate to the correct side of the road 88% of the time. 
Coordinates toward the end are 100% precise, though on the incorrect side of the road. 
On a typical 12 ft lane road, the GPS can adequately determine the proper side and is thus effectively 88% precise to 12 feet.
In addition to the NMEA sentences, the spreadsheet contains the time it took for the GPS to properly output the date, time, and coordinates.

PrecisionData lists 29 tests of the GPS device with 5-7 coordinates taken each time.
Coordinates were taken and compared to a known location.
The average precision for the 29 trials was calculated to be 3.35 meters or 11.0 feet.

RoomAndCheckpoint_Coordinates lists the coordinates of each of the desired rooms and coordinates

RoomToRoom_withCheckpoints lists the simplistic route from checkpoint to locations

WingCoordinates lists the bounds of each of the wings from the top left to top right
